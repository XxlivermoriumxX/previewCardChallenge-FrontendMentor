## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use clamp() for responsive sizing.

```css
font-size: clamp(0.875, 2.5vw, 1rem);
width: clamp(20rem, 85vw, 24rem);
```

### Continued development

This project forced me to focus on responsive styles without using media queries. I plan on incorporating the tools I have learned into future projects to improve UX.

### Useful resources

- [Web Dev Article on min(), max(), and clamp()](https://web.dev/articles/min-max-clamp) - This article helped me understand the uses of min(), max(), and clamp() through visuals.
- [Responsive CSS without media queries](https://blog.dai.codes/responsive-css-without-media-queries/) - This article goes over different ways to make a page responsive using the real life example of the site the author was building.
